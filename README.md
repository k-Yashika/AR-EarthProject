# AR-EarthProject
As part of my final year project, I developed this game in Unity for school-going kids in elementary grades. 

The play of this experience is simple. It visually allows us to experience the effects of deforestation and biodiversity. 
In the application, when the deforestation button is clicked, all trees and wildlife begin to disappear demonstrating the long-term effects of deforestation. 
When the biodiversity button is clicked, trees and animals begin to reappear. 

Below are some images of the experience.
